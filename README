This is a tiny Java library for converting between JSON and Java collections.
It is dependent on dfh.grammar.

What it can do
--------------

1. This library can convert a JSON object or array into a Java Map<String, Object>
or List<Object>.

2. It can convert a Java Map<String, Object>, List<Object>, or Object[], into a
JSON string.

3. The Objects must be of types Map<String, Object>, List<Object>, Object[], Integer,
Number, String, Boolean, or null. These are the types that may go in and will come
out. In the case of Number, the subtype returned will be Double.
