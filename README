This is a tiny Java library for converting between JSON and Java collections.
It is dependent on dfh.grammar.

What it can do
--------------

1. This library can convert a JSON object or array into a Java Map<String, Object>
or List<Object>.

2. It can convert a Java Map<String, Object>, List<Object>, or Object[], into a
JSON string.

3. The Objects must be of types Map<String, Object>, List<Object>, Object[], Integer,
Number, String, Boolean, or null. These are the types that may go in and will come
out. In the case of Number, the subtype returned will be Double.

4. If you have a JSON string stripped of unnecessary whitespace and you want to make 
it human-readable, you can use the String Converter.pretty(String) method to add in
missing whitespace and indentation.

5. If you have a puffy JSON string that you want to compress, removing all unnecessary
whitespace, you can pass it through String Converter.compress(String).
